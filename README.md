C++ Practice - Tic Tac Toe Game

I've created this game as practice for an upcoming c++ class. 

This program could use a lot of cleaning up. However, I wanted to practice creating objects and manipulating the object's variables in c++ and hacked together this program with very little SFML knowledge or experience.
